# Deductive Wine Taster
Currently in an alpha stage of development to port from the original Java version to React Native.

## Description
A tool for blind tasting wine with the deductive tasting format.

Use Deductive Wine Taster to memorize the deductive tasting format suggested by the Court of Master Sommeliers Americas in preparation for the Certified Sommelier examination and its possible grape varieties and growing regions used in the exam.

Keep record of your tasting history! Save the results of your guess and the actual wine variety is revealed to be for review later. The application will also attempt to make a guess of grape variety base on your own input of wine characteristics!

This is most useful for those studying and tasting for the Certified Sommelier examination for the Court of Master Sommeliers Americas. The application is modeled after and will only accept information in relation to the accepted grape varieties and growing regions for red and white wine that are used in the certified examination.
